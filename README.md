This is the final project of the Coursera course: Data Analysis with Python. 

Summary of tasks: 
1. Data wrangling - replacing and dropping missing values of certain columns, change the datatype to the correct ones
2. Exploratory data analysis - check value counts of certain variables, use seaborn to create boxplots and regplot to visualize data 
3. Model development - fit data into linear regression models and use R^2 to evaluate the model accuracy 
4. Model evaluation and refinement - use sklearn to split and train dataset; fit data in Ridge regression and second order polynomial and compare R^2 values
